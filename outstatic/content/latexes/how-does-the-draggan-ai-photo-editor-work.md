Do you ever wish you could effortlessly edit your photos without the hassle of complex software? Well, now you can with DragGAN AI, an innovative photo editor powered by advanced [artificial intelligence technology](https://dragganaitool.com/).

With DragGAN AI, all you need to do is click on the image to define pairs of handle points and target points, and watch as the magic unfolds!

Let’s dive into the workings of DragGAN AI and understand the underlying formulas in a simple and friendly way. Also, Read the [DragGAN AI website](https://dragganaitool.com/draggan-ai-tool-website/) post.

DragGAN AI is built upon the StyleGAN2 architecture, which utilizes a latent code 𝒛 to generate images. This latent code is transformed into an intermediate latent code 𝒘, which is then fed into the generator 𝐺 to produce the final image. The generator uses different layers to control various attributes of the image, and it can be seen as modeling an image manifold.
