[**DragGAN**](https://dragganaitool.com/) is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can transform images of objects into different visual styles by dragging a reference image.

<br>

The “**Seed**” value determines the starting point for image generation. Adjust this value to generate an initial image that serves as the basis for the subsequent transformations. Experimenting with different seed values can yield diverse and interesting outcomes.

<br>

To [guide the DragGAN AI tool](https://dragganaitool.com/how-to-use-draggan-ai/) in making specific changes to the image, you can add reference points. These points act as markers for indicating the desired modifications. By placing reference points strategically, you can control how the DragGAN AI model transforms the image.

<br>

As the **DragGAN AI model** runs, you will observe the red reference point moving toward the blue reference point. The image displayed in the right section of the interface will update dynamically, reflecting the changes generated by the **DragGAN AI model**.
