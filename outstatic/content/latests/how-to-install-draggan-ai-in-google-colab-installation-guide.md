As the **DragGAN AI model** runs, you will observe the red reference point moving toward the blue reference point. The image displayed in the right section of the interface will update dynamically, reflecting the changes generated by the **DragGAN AI model**.

The visual transformation process can be fascinating to watch as the image evolves according to the movement of the reference points.<br>
