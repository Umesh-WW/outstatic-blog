***OUR OVEREAGER PARTY—AN**** elvish druid; a dwarven wizard; a halfling rogue; and a human paladin—has arrived at a dusty, cluttered library. Hearing of our quest for the fabled Orb of Zarekath, the head librarian—Thimblewick, a gnome—recounts how it was once “a powerful artifact” that has long since disappeared in the nearby ruined city.*



*“Oh, sorry,” the rogue says with a disarming smile. “I was just looking for a quiet place to read. I must have gotten turned around.”*

Then comes a break in the action—a disruption in the very fabric of space-time—as we, the players of this game of Dungeons & Dragons, find ourselves correcting the almighty dungeon master, or DM.

***Players:**** Thanks for all this description, but in the future, it would be great if the players could describe the actions of the characters.*

***Dungeon Master:**** Sure, I understand. As an* [*AI language model*](https://www.wired.com/story/how-chatgpt-works-large-language-model/)*, I am programmed to respond to your requests and help guide the story based on the information you provide. So, feel free to describe your characters’ actions and make decisions for them as you see fit. I will do my best to provide responses and keep the story engaging and interesting.*

In D&D, the DM is the chief storyteller and referee who builds the world and interprets the many rolls, roles, and rules of the game. But what the *characters* say or do is the job of the players. When your DM is an AI and it steps on your dice-rollin’, character-building toes, it feels good to talk back to the machine: “[I’m sorry, ChatGPT, I’m afraid you can’t do that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qnd-hdmgfk)”

Sadly, having to dictate a metafictional correction dispels the illusion. We are not adventurers, but plain boring humans, playing a tabletop game in our mundane, non-magical universe. Perhaps we ought to be more patient. Our particular DM has never played D&D, and it’s not even human. We’ve asked ChatGPT to play what we’re calling “ChatD&D.”

**SOME CONTEXT: WE** are two Gen-X gamers who’ve been playing D&D since the Jimmy Carter Administration. ChatD&D was an attempt to see if computer-driven, role-playing experiences had improved since the days of classic text-based games like *Zork* and *Colossal Cave Adventure*, which merely guided players through pre-generated scripts
